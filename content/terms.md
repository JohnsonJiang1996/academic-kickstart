summary: To solve this problem and improve tracking performance, we propose an
  algorithm that incorporates deep features. A sparse representation method is
  used to filter deep features and improve their complexity. Then, a Siamese
  network is used to judge the similarities between the target and template and
  determine a confidence level. Next, a single shot multibox detector (SSD) is
  introduced to support tracking, which is activated when the confidence level
  falls below a certain threshold.
