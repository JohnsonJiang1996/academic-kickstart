abstract: "We propose a long-term tracking algorithm by combining the short-term tracker and the YOLO v2 detector. We use the SURF algorithm to get the similarity of the tracking result and the current contrast template, once the similarity is lower than a threshold, the YOLO v2 will be activated and find the right target through a three-stage cascade selecting mechanism we designed before."
